# poll-app-project
made a poll app, I'm trying to implement user login and registration
tried multiple ways to make a user registration and user login page in Django and didn't work
every piece of code is still there
The site works, we are able to access polls and the admin page runs, we need help with the User registration page and creating the user login, and a home page
To access polls http://127.0.0.1:8000/polls/
if want to access admin change polls to admin
usesrname: admin
password: admin
